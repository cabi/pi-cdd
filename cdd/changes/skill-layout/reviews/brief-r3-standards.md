<!--
R3 standards-axis review brief (skill cdd-code-review, Standards axis),
instantiated for change skill-layout by the author session (family: zai,
glm-5.3). Reviewer: cold sub-agent, family opencode-zen (deepseek-v4-pro) —
differs from the author's family per rule 2b. Repo: working tree on branch
skill-layout (base main @ 1750767), change uncommitted — the diff is the
staged renames + unstaged edits + the untracked change folder. This file is
the reviewer's entire brief; nothing else rides along. TWO AXES = TWO
SESSIONS: the Spec axis runs in its own cold session with its own brief.

# R3 standards-axis review — skill-layout

## Change identity

- Change: `cdd/changes/skill-layout/`
- Artifact under review: the implementation diff `1750767...working tree`
  — the Standards axis of R3, run at Close
- Review point: R3 (code review), before archive; this brief covers the
  **Standards axis only** — the Spec axis runs in its own separate session
  with its own brief (`assets/brief-r3-spec.md`)

## Reviewer session requirements

- You are a **cold session**: fresh, not the author's session. Read only the
  paths and diff below, from disk at the pinned state. Loop law rule 2b — the
  reviewer is not the author of the artifacts under review.
- Your model family must differ from the author's model family (family = same
  provider or model lineage). Verify your own family from your runtime
  environment (e.g. `PI_PROVIDER`) — the brief states the author's family,
  never yours as settled fact. If you cannot establish that the families
  differ, say so in your findings header and stop.
- You review ONE axis: Standards. Do not evaluate spec compliance here; the
  other axis has its own session so neither frames the other.

## Inputs (paths, pinned state)

- Diff command: `git diff 1750767` (staged + unstaged) plus reads of the untracked change folder `cdd/changes/skill-layout/` — the change is an uncommitted working tree
- Commit list: none yet (working tree; base main @ 1750767)
- `cdd/rules.md` — loop law (incl. mechanical-change rules).
- Standards documents this repo names: `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` conventions
  sections, plus the smell baseline charter in `skills/cdd-code-review/SKILL.md`.
- `cdd/decisions/` — accepted ADRs whose `code:` globs the diff touches.
- The change folder `cdd/changes/skill-layout/` for context only (what the
  diff claims to be).

## Scope fence

- In scope: the diff's conformance to documented conventions and accepted
  decisions.
- Out of scope: whether the diff implements the change's scenarios (Spec
  axis, separate session), proposing redesigns, any fix. You report
  findings; you do not edit files.

## MUST-DELIVER checklist (the charter)

1. **Conventions** — the diff follows the repo's documented standards
   (naming, structure, error handling, test placement) as written in the
  standards docs.
2. **ADR-governed files respected** — files under an accepted ADR's `code:`
   globs change only in ways the ADR sanctions; violations of a recorded
  decision are findings.
3. **Smell baseline** — the diff against the skill's smell list, quoted
   verbatim from `skills/cdd-code-review/SKILL.md` step 3 (Mysterious Name,
   Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Repeated
   Switches, Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality,
   Message Chains, Middle Man, Refused Bequest): new instances are findings;
   pre-existing ones are not; a documented repo standard overrides the
   baseline; tooling-enforced items are skipped.
4. **Guard/validator alignment** — the code agrees with what the
   deterministic doors expect (`cdd/scripts/spec-drift.mjs`,
   `lib/validate.mjs`, CI): changes that weaken, bypass, or blind a door
   (the guard, validators, CI) are findings, and so is silent divergence — e.g. law text that no longer
   renders byte-identically from its single source; a red door is a fact,
   not an obstacle.

## Findings grammar (advisory — no fixes, no verdicts)

Each finding: severity `blocker` | `should` | `note`, the finding, evidence
(path:line). You report every finding with disposition `open`; the author
later sets `fixed:` or `won't-fix:` when disposing.
Never red/green verdicts; gate authority stays with the deterministic validators and the human.

## Output

Write your findings to `cdd/changes/skill-layout/reviews/r3-standards-code-review.md`
(output path per `reviewPoint("R3").findingsStandards` in `lib/loop-law.mjs` — the
standards-axis file; you write only this file, never the spec axis's). Header records your reviewer form (cold sub-agent /
same-session re-read) and your model family vs. the author's.
