## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Declarative style is door-1 law

The authoring corpus and rule 4 prescribe declarative scenarios — observable behavior and outcomes, never interaction mechanics such as keystrokes, widgets, or selectors — and state that imperative step prose is a door-1 review finding. The validator carries exactly 0 style lexicons or step-count heuristics: style is never machine-checked. The corpus and rule 4 never name the extension's released package version, so a release bump finds no stale literal to turn a corpus pin red.

```gherkin
Feature: Declarative style is door-1 law

Scenario: Corpus teaches the fenced declarative format
  Given the extension at its released package version
  When the delta template, the delta authoring instruction, and cdd rule 4 are read
  Then each of the 3 names the fenced Feature document with the pin comment inside, and the declarative style clause banning interaction mechanics, and none of the 3 names the extension's released package version

Scenario: Imperative step prose stays green
  Given a change delta whose scenario steps phrase interaction mechanics like clicks and keystrokes in otherwise valid gherkin
  When cdd validate runs on the change in draft mode
  Then the verdict is green because style is door-1 judgment and never machine-checked
  # Verified by: tests/acceptance/gherkin-style-guidance.test.js

Scenario: The validator exports no style-checking surface
  Given the gherkin validation module of the extension
  When its exported surface is listed and an imperative scenario body is checked
  Then it exports exactly the fence extraction and fence checking functions and returns 0 style errors for the imperative body
